Forgive my mistakes in programs and articles.
There should be plenty.
I am far from being as good as I would like to be.

## [EE](https://github.com/r00m3/EE)

_Electrical Engineering notes,\
drawings and exercises._
<br/>
<br/>

##### [Drawings](https://github.com/r00m3/r00m3/edit/main/README.txt#drawings)
- Illustrating PoC of boolean algebra
using transistors in LTSpice.
##### Notes
- Boolean algebra.
- Electrical components.


## Studies
##### [github.com/r00m3/Studies](https://github.com/r00m3/Studies)

		My works in study environment:

			- Pneumatic.
			- Computer architecture PoC
			  (MMIO using two ICs and 3 transistors).


## RPI_Pico_Projects
##### [github.com/r00m3/RPI_Pico_Projects](https://github.com/r00m3/RPI_Pico_Projects)


		Quick simple projects
		to get more familiar with uCs.


## Menpo
##### [github.com/r00m3/Menpo](https://github.com/r00m3/Menpo)


		Proof of Concept
		for file encryption/decryption/hash.


Generate sha256sum of local file.
Encrypt local file.
Decrypt local file.
	- Symmetric authenticated encryption.
	- AES GCM.
	- Cryptographically secure pseudo random 12 byte nonce.
	- Cryptographically secure pseudo random 16 byte secret key.


## Boggart
##### [github.com/r00m3/Boggart](https://github.com/r00m3/Boggart)

		Purpose of program Boggart is to convert user input
		from one form to another.

Input ->
	- base-16
	- base-10
	- base-2
	- Unicode


## Vellum of Cryptography
##### [github.com/r00m3/Vellum_of_Cryptography](https://github.com/r00m3/Vellum_of_Cryptography)


		Presenting my current knowledge about cryptography.
		In easy to read simplified CLI app.
		Could be used as introduction material about this topic.


## Requester
##### [github.com/r00m3/Requester](https://github.com/r00m3/Requester)

		Little tool to send custom HTTP requests
		and receive responses.


Just an early draft...
